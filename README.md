# Smart-Green-House-with-adjustable-parameters-using-RFID

In this project, you will see how to make your own smart greenhouse with customisable parameters using RFID. The measured sensor values are nicely displayed in a Grafana dashboard via a Grafana server.  You can use this in the industry, for example, to reduce costs in terms of actuator energy or to get a better picture of the situation your plants are in. This way, the plants will always have the ideal environment so they grow faster and healthier.

Folder ‘Documentation + tutorial’:
All hardware and software are in the document ‘Documentatie Serre’ and the explanation to set up a Grafana server is in the document ‘Grafana server’.

Folder ‘Code’:
The code for the ESP32 and the RaspberryPi (MQTT - InfluxDB bridge) are both in this folder.

Folder ‘PCB’:
Here you will find the electronic schematic and pcb design. For more explanation of the circuits, please see ‘Documentatie Serre’.
